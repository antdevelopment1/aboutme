          My name is April Copes. I am 27 years old and I was born and raised in Newark, NJ. I am excited to be pursuing a career in software development. I currently work for a conveyor 
          installations company as an industrial Electrical Supervisor, where I get to install, upgrade, and troubleshoot electrical conveyor systems throughout the country. My interest 
          in computer programming was indirectly sparked by my current position. Once I started to learn more about the possibilities of software development, for me there was no turning 
          back. Below are videos of some of the kind of systems I've worked with and built. Most of these types of systems are high voltage and VERY dangerous. In the third video, you can 
          see what happens when two wires from two different phases touch each other in a controlled environment. Luckily, I have never seen one of this magnitude up close but still mesmerizing 
          none the less.

            Prior to my electrical pursuits, I dabbled in different aspects of carpentry, furniture making, and wood finishing. Before that, I was a music instructor at a music institute for four years, 
            where I taught children and adults at various playing levels how to play guitar, bass, and drums. Most of my musical influences stem from classic rock, orchestral/classical, hard rock, metal, 
            and blues. I'm passionate about music, art, learning, teaching, coding, electricity, science, and a plethora of many other topics. I love working with people and truly crave collaborative settings. 
            Below are some of my favorite bands and songs to listen to and the third video is one of my favorite amateur drummers.

            My goals in attending Digital Crafts are to become a proficient and independent software engineer capable of contributing to almost any software engineering team. I would also love to cultivate
            the skills I've learned to encourage others interested in learning how to code to take action. I would love to see more people inspired to try to learn new things such as coding and not to be 
            discouraged by the "you need to be a rocket scientist" perspective many people have when deciding not to move forward in this career field. I truly believe in the power of computer software and 
            can't wait to be challenged, pushed, and surrounded with like-minded people striving towards similar goals.
